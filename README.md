## NOTES API

In this README, I will not go into too much detail and at least create a guide on how to use the API. This is a project where I was looking to get back to programming, as I had been idle for several days. Yes, I recognize that this API has several security issues, such as the user being able to log in by simply entering a cookie and an ID. However, considering this, I am still happy because I tested a new organization for my project. That's all, I hope you like it.
